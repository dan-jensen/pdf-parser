This RubyGem is intended to be used with Adobe XFA/Acroform PDFs and relies heavily on both  [Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri) and [Origami](https://github.com/gdelugre/origami)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pdf-parser'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pdf-parser

## Usage


In order to parse a PDF and return it's XML data, you need to use the **.parse** method.

```ruby

Pdf::Parser.parse "somedynmaicforms.pdf"

```

This will return a [Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri) XML object, which you can then parse using Nokogiri's library.

```ruby

xml = Pdf::Parser.parse "somedynmaicforms.pdf"

value = xml.xpath("//AttributeName").text

```

This will return the XML data for the AttributeName so it can be used elsewhere in your app.

If you wish, you can also print the XML to the console by passing an additional arugment, true, when calling the parse method.  


```ruby

xml = Pdf::Parser.parse("somedynmaicforms.pdf", true)

```
